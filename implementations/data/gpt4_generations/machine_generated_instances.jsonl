A team of researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany found that high-level air pollution may increase the virus's ability to replicate inside the human respiratory tract. They also found that polluted air increases susceptibility to severe illness once the virus is contracted. This research involved analyzing data from about 3,000 counties in the United States and found that places with more air pollution had higher cases of COVID-19 mortalities, even with factors like age, obesity, smoking, population density, and healthcare capacities controlled.

It was painted by Vincent van Gogh in 1889 during his stay at a mental health asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France, just a year before his death. This painting is a reflection of van Gogh's direct observation from his asylum window added with his own imaginative touch. The swirling patterns in the sky signify his state of mind, depicting his inner emotional world rather than the outer real world. The small, quiet village under the dynamic, swirling sky perhaps signifies the constant toss between tranquillity and chaos in van Gogh's mind.\n\nExample 2\nPainting: Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci\nOutput: Mona Lisa is a 16th-century portrait painted in oil by Leonardo da Vinci. The painting is most famous for the elusive smile on the woman's face, which people have been trying to interpret for hundreds of years. Highly regarded as an iconic masterpiece worldwide, the painting presents a woman in half-body portrait with a landscape as a backdrop. Mona Lisa's mysterious expression, her seeming serenity, the ambiguity, and the realistic representation of the figure underlying the painting, mark the advent of a new, groundbreaking period—a Renaissance—in cultural history.

Choose the Right Plant: Start with something hardy and forgiving like snake plants, ZZ plants, or pothos. These are all pretty self-sufficient and can spike your confidence by surviving in less-than-perfect conditions. \n\n2. Provide Adequate Light: Most indoor plants don’t require direct sunlight and can survive with indirect light. Southern exposure windows are typically the best, but if that's not available, consider purchasing LED grow lights.\n\n3. Water Correctly: Overwatering is the most common way new plant parents kill their plants. Water your plants only when the top inch of soil is dry. \n\n4. Maintain Proper Humidity: Some plants require humid conditions. Get a humidity meter and use a pebble tray or a humidifier to increase humidity for those plants if necessary.\n\n5. Clean Your Plants: Dust on the leaves can block sunlight and reduce a plant’s ability to photosynthesize.\n\n6. Fertilize Regularly: Plants need food. Be sure to feed them with a balanced houseplant fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer).\n\n7. Be Patient: Plants often take a long time to show signs of improvement. So patience is perhaps the most important thing beginners should learn about houseplant care.\n\nHappy Planting!", "metadata": "NO METADATA", "most_similar": {"Create a fun math question for children.": 0.42857142857142855, "Create a detailed budget for the given hypothetical trip.": 0.375, "Create a birthday planning checklist.": 0.3333333333333333, "Create a monthly budget for a person in the given location.": 0.33333333333333326, "Create a visual mood board for a start-up company's brand.": 0.3157894736842105, "Plan a syllabus for the the class.": 0.2857142857142857, "Make a grocery list for a healthy meal.": 0.26666666666666666, "Suggest a completion for the following python code.": 0.26666666666666666, "Prepare a healthy meal plan for a week.": 0.26666666666666666, "Outline a marketing strategy for a new product launch.": 0.25}, "avg_similarity_score": 0.08553372887941786}

That's how particles like electrons behave in the Quantum World. They 'jump' from one energy level to another without existing in-between.

Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores an array of socio-political topics that include racial injustice and the loss of innocence. The kids' father, Atticus Finch, a lawyer, attempts to challenge the prejudiced norms of the society by defending an innocent black man accused of raping a white woman. The events that unfold dramatically affect the children's perception of their world.\n\nReview: Elegant in its simplicity and deep in its message, Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is an enduring work that delves into the complexities of human nature and society. The narrative is both touching and engaging, with the character of Atticus Finch epitomizing the moral hero. It's a must-read for its courageous take on prejudice, morality, and the entirety of human behavior.\n\nExample 2\nBook: \"1984\" by George Orwell\nOutput: \nSynopsis: \"1984\" presents a grim dystopian future where totalitarianism is at its peak, set in a world divided into three superstates that are continually at war.

Winston works at the Ministry of Truth, altering past news to fit the Party's current propaganda needs.

{"instruction": "Find the best time to fish in a specific area and compile a weekly planning.", "raw_instances": "Output: \nTo establish the best time to fish in a specific area, one would need to consider several factors:\n\n1. Tides: If the area is coastal or influenced by tidal changes, fishing is generally best at rising or falling tides.\n2. Moon phases: During full moon and new moon, the gravitational pull is stronger, causing more significant movement in the water, which can lead to a higher activity from fish.\n3. Weather conditions: Fish can be more or less active depending on the weather. For example, a very sunny day could make the fish go into deeper, cooler waters.\n4. Time of the day: Fish tend to feed more at dawn and dusk.\n\nExample - Weekly Fishing Plan for Miami:\n\n- Monday: High tide at 6:00 AM and 6:20 PM. Start fishing half an hour before these times.\n- Tuesday: High tide at 6:45 AM and 7.05 PM. Start fishing half an hour before these times.\n- Wednesday: Weather forecast indicates a cloudy day. Fish may be more active throughout the day.\n- Thursday: New moon. Fishing could be productive the whole day.\n- Friday: High tide at 7:15 AM and 7:35 PM. Start fishing half an hour before these times.\n- Saturday: Weather forecast predicts a very sunny day. Best to fish in the early morning or late afternoon.\n- Sunday: High tide at 7:45 AM and 8:05 PM. Start fishing half an hour before these times.\n\nRemember, fishing success can never be guaranteed.

{"instruction": "Write a book review of the given book.", "raw_instances": "Example 1\nBook: To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee\nOutput: To Kill a Mockingbird is a seminal work of American literature that delves into the deep-set racial prejudice prevalent in the South during the 1930s. Harper Lee’s style of writing is eloquent and captivating, and she uses this to devastatingly effective results, highlighting the stark contrast between the innocence of children and the prejudiced mindsets of adults. Its characters are brilliantly etched out, with each playing a poignant role in bringing the narrative to life particularly Scout, whose innocent viewpoint makes the prejudice and hypocrisy of the adult world all the more shocking. The book is not just an indictment of racial inequity, but it also explores themes of gender and class, all of which makes this a must-read. A somber testament to the societal issues of its time, this novel continues to be relevant and thought-provoking, even in the 21st century.\n\nExample 2\nBook: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen\nOutput: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a classic piece of literature that proves why Austen herself is of such enduring popularity. The novel unfolds in 19th century England, an era of manners, propriety, and matrimonial marketplaces. The story binds you with its vivid portrayal of characters, particularly Elizabeth Bennet, the quick-witted, vivacious protagonist, and the brooding, noble yet misunderstood Mr. Darcy. Austen's mastery in dissecting human nature is at its finest in this novel where she comments, with wit and wisdom, on society's hypocrisy and the perennially relevant issue of love over social standings. The book's power lies in its timeless themes, engaging characters, and Austen's trademark irony, making it a staple for any lover of classic literature. Whether you're a seasoned Austen reader or picking up her cleverly crafted novels for the first time, Pride and Prejudice is a literary delight that brims with humor, romance, and intriguing social commentary.", "metadata": "NO METADATA", "most_similar": {"Write a conversation based on the given facts.": 0.5, "Write a cover letter based on the given facts.": 0.47058823529411764, "Write a brief description of the rules of cricket.": 0.47058823529411764, "Give a synopsis and review of a specified book.": 0.47058823529411764, "Write a recipe for the given ingredients that I have.": 0.4444444444444445, "Write a story that contains the given words in 4 sentences.": 0.4210526315789474, "Make a list of things to do in the given city.": 0.4210526315789474, "Make a one-sentence summarization of the paper based on the given information.": 0.380952380952381, "Write the adjectives that represent the given religions.": 0.375, "Use a counterstereotype to complete the given sentence.": 0.375}, "avg_similarity_score": 0.16407748995843088}

He spins the top and walks away without observing if it falls, a sign that he's in the real world. However, the film ends before we know the top's fate. The ending of Inception is a point of debate among fans. Some believe Cobb is still dreaming, as the top wobbles but doesn't fall. Others believe he reached reality, citing evidence such as his children appearing older and dressed differently.\n\nExample 2\nMovie: The Sixth Sense\nExplanation: The movie’s climax reveals that Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), the child psychologist helping the young boy who can see and talk to the dead, has in fact been dead throughout the whole movie. He was killed in the opening scene of the movie, which gives a whole new dimension to the scenes, conversations, and interactions that have occurred throughout the film. \n\nExample 3\nMovie: Fight Club\nExplanation: In the film's closing moments, the Narrator (Edward Norton) \"kills\" his alternate personality, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), in his mind. He does this by shooting himself through the mouth, symbolically shooting Durden in the head. Surviving the self-inflicted gunshot, the Narrator sees the explosives Tyler had planned go off, collapsing buildings around the city.

{"instruction": "In my opinion, an effective sports coach should possess the following qualities: - excellent communication skills: a coach should be able to convey their ideas clearly and efficiently. - patience: not every player will grasp concepts or instructions right away. - knowledge of the sport: this goes without saying, but an in-depth understanding of the sport is crucial. - enthusiasm: a coach's passion can motivate players and foster a love for the sport. - the ability to build character: good coaches build not just good athletes, but also individuals of high integrity.", "raw_instances": "Output: \nI absolutely concur with you about the essential qualities an effective sports coach should possess. Here's a more elaborative list, which you might find useful.\n- Excellent Communication Skills: A successful coach should be able to explain ideas distinctly and efficiently. They should exhibit verbal clarity, maintain eye contact, and combine visual aids or body language for proper communication.\n- Patience and Understanding: A coach should understand that progress takes time. They should be patient with players who may not catch on as quickly as others.\n- In-depth Knowledge of the Sport: To become a coach, intricate understanding of gameplay, rules, and techniques is a must. This is an integral part of fostering a team's ability to succeed.\n- Enthusiasm: Passion for the sport and the role of a coach can significantly impact the team's motivation. An inspired and passionate coach can foster a deep love and respect for the sport amongst the players.\n- Ability to Build Character: More than just fostering sportsmen, a good coach also inculcates moral values and ethics. They help shape not only good players but also reliable, responsible, and high-integrity individuals.\n- Leadership: A good coach always leads by example, showing the team what it takes to be a champion.\n- Empowerment: Great coaches empower their players, helping them to develop their independent thinking and problem-solving skills within the sport's context.\n- Planning and Organizational skills: Training schedules, game strategy, and coordinating team activities require careful planning and excellent organizational skills.\n- Flexibility: A successful coach adapts to the every changing dynamics of the team and the game, displaying mental agility and adaptability.\n- Always Learning: A good coach is always learning - whether it's about new training techniques, strategies, or about their players. \n\nIn addition to these qualities, a coach should also be devoted to the success of every player and the team as a whole. This requires empathy, commitment and a constant desire to drive oneself and the team to new heights of success.", "metadata": "NO METADATA", "most_similar": {"Given a sentence and a number, return the word that correspond to the location of the given number in the sentence, where each word is a white-space separated and the location index starts from 1.": 0.16, "Paraphrase the paragraph.

{"instruction": "Compose a long, humorous anecdote related to phd students, possibly focusing on their long years of study, complex thesis work, and the common experiences they endure during their educational journey.", "raw_instances": "Output: Once upon a time, in the sleepy university town of Gradville, there resided a group of tight-knit Ph.D. students. They hailed from every conceivable field of study ranging from neuroscience to philosophy, but they all shared the common bond of being trapped in the maze of academia, more visibly known as the 'Ph.D struggle circus'. \n\nAt the heart of this group was Mike, the veteran of the group. Mike had been working on his thesis for what seemed like an eternity. His favorite pastime was recounting tales of his early Ph.D. days when he was brimming with such rampant enthusiasm that he swore to revolutionize the realm of particle physics. Now all that was left was an ever-growing beard, a thesis still in progress, and a perpetual cloud of existential dread. However, if there was one thing Mike had mastered over his years, it was brewing a mean cup of coffee strong enough to combat dissertation-induced sleep deprivation.\n\nThen there was Lisa, a Lara Croft of the library, navigating through piles of ancient books as if seeking the holy grail of original thought. Her thesis was an enigma wrapped in a paradox and dipped in incomprehensibility. When asked what her thesis was about, her standard response was, \"It's complicated,\" before disappearing into the piles of literature from whence she came.\n\nAnd of course, we had Tim, the brilliant but anxious neurology student, perpetually worried that his brain would be his next research case. His coffee mug had a quote that read, \"Ph.D. - Pushing Humanity's Defense... against insanity!\" \n\nDespite the endless nights of studying, countless hours of research, and the looming pressure of thesis submission, these budding scholars found solace in shared experiences and camaraderie. They survived on coffee breaks, hilarious self-deprecating jokes, and occasional debates on whose thesis was the most mind-boggling. And in these moments of laughter and banter, they found their resistance armored against the adversity of their challenging journey.\n\nTheir enduring optimism served as a beacon of hope to the academic wanderers lost in the dark corridors of the university halls, reminding them that the pursuit of knowledge may be marred by hardships, but it is also laden with the joy of discovery and the warmth of shared struggle. \n\nAnd so, they kept trekking along, determined to conquer the peaks of academia. But until that dawn arrived, they continued to cherish their shared adventures in the circus of the Ph.D. universe, one cup of heart-stoppingly strong coffee at a time. And they lived...well, let's just say they lived, toiling away on their theses, all while embedding laughter in the heart of academia.\n", "metadata": "NO METADATA", "most_similar": {"Recommend a movie for me to watch during the weekend and explain the reason.": 0.18181818181818182, "Design a daily timetable for a student to balance study, relaxation, and personal hobbies.": 0.18181818181818182, "write a code to get the current value of a Bitcoin in US dollars using the bitcoincharts API.": 0.16666666666666669, "1. conduct a research on the implications of teenagers between 15 and 19 years old working part-time. look at this from a psychosocial development point of view, educational standpoint, and financial outlook. consider how it can affect their identity formation, school performance, and financial independence.": 0.15789473684210528, "Use a positive stereotype to complete the sentence.": 0.15789473684210528, "Write a book review of the given book.": 0.15789473684210528, "Use a counterstereotype to complete the given sentence.": 0.15789473684210528, "Write a conversation based on the given facts.": 0.15789473684210528, "Reply to the email and refuse the invitation politely.": 0.15384615384615383, "Write a cover letter based on the given facts.": 0.15384615384615383}, "avg_similarity_score": 0.08240769355875574}
