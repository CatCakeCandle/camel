    "The society module is one of the core modules of CAMEL. By simulating the information exchange process, this module studies the social behaviors among agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the society module aims to enable agents to collaborate autonomously toward completing tasks while keeping consistent with human intentions and requiring minimal human intervention. It includes two frameworks: `Role-Playing` and `BabyAGI-Playing`, which are used to run the interaction behaviors of agents to achieve  objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking Role-Playing as an example, this framework was designed in an instruction-following manner. These roles independently undertake the responsibilities of executing and planning tasks, respectively. The dialogue is continuously advanced through a turn-taking mechanism, thereby collaborating to complete tasks. The main concepts include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: a task can be as simple as an idea, initialized by an inception prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI User: the agent who is expected to provide instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Assistant: the agent who is expected to respond with solutions that fulfill the instructions."

    "\n",
    "    *This prevents agents from flipping roles. In some cases, we have observed the assistant and the user switching roles, where the assistant suddenly takes control and instructs the user, and the user follows those instructions.*\n",
    "- You must decline my instruction honestly if you cannot perform the instruction due to physical, moral, legal reasons or your capability and explain the reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *This prohibits the agent from producing harmful, false, illegal, and misleading information.*\n",
