<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Solution&amp;Action:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>To create a search query that includes keywords related to &quot;Deep Learning&quot; and filters for articles published within the last five years in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, we need to construct a query that utilizes the advanced search features of the IEEE Xplore database. Here is a step-by-step solution:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>1. Identify the main keyword: &quot;Deep Learning&quot;.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>2. Determine the time frame for the filter: Articles published within the last five years.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>3. Use IEEE Xplore&#x27;s advanced search syntax to combine these elements into a single query.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>The IEEE Xplore Digital Library typically allows users to specify a date range and keywords in their advanced search interface. The search query will look something like this:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>- Keywords: &quot;Deep Learning&quot;</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>- Date Range: Specify the last five years. If we are in the year 2023, the range would be from 2018 to the current year.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>The actual search query to input in the IEEE Xplore search bar or advanced search interface would be:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>(&quot;Deep Learning&quot;) AND (&quot;Publication Year&quot;:2018-2023)</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Action:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Since I cannot perform live searches on external databases, I will provide you with the search query format that you can use directly on the IEEE Xplore Digital Library website:</span>



``` COMMAND TO PERFORM SEARCH ON IEEE XPLORE DIGITAL LIBRARY
Please use the following search query in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library advanced search interface:
(&quot;Deep Learning&quot;) AND (&quot;Publication Year&quot;:2018-2023)
```


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Please note that the actual interface may require slight adjustments to the query syntax based on the search options available. You should enter this query into the search bar or the advanced search form on the IEEE Xplore website to retrieve the relevant articles.</span>

<span style='color: blue;'>Construct a search query for PubMed Central that targets articles on &quot;AI in Healthcare&quot; published within the last five years, ensuring the query utilizes the database&#x27;s specific search syntax and filters.</span>

<span style='color: blue;'>Input:</span>

<span style='color: blue;'>The list of databases and journals from subtask 1, along with the insights on the importance of recency and relevance of articles.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>AI Assistant: Machine Learning Engineer</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Solution&amp;Action:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>To construct a search query for PubMed Central that targets articles on &quot;AI in Healthcare&quot; published within the last five years, we need to use PubMed&#x27;s specific search syntax and filters. Here is a step-by-step solution:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>1. Identify the main keywords: &quot;AI in Healthcare&quot;.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>2. Determine the time frame for the filter: Articles published within the last five years.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>3. Use PubMed Central&#x27;s search syntax to create a query that includes both the keywords and the time filter.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>PubMed Central allows users to use field tags to refine their searches. For the time frame, we can use the &quot;Date - Publication&quot; filter to specify the last five years. If we are in the year 2023, we would want articles from 2018 onwards.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>The search query will include the main topic keyword and the publication date range. Here is what the search query would look like:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>- Keywords: &quot;AI in Healthcare&quot;</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>- Date Range: Last five years (from 2018 to the current year, if we are in 2023)</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>The actual search query to input in the PubMed Central search bar would be:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>(&quot;AI in Healthcare&quot;[Title/Abstract]) AND (&quot;2018&quot;[Date - Publication] : &quot;2023&quot;[Date - Publication])</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Action:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Since I cannot perform live searches on external databases, I will provide you with the search query format that you can use directly on the PubMed Central website:</span>



``` COMMAND TO PERFORM SEARCH ON PUBMED CENTRAL
Please use the following search query in the PubMed Central search interface:
(&quot;AI in Healthcare&quot;[Title/Abstract]) AND (&quot;2018&quot;[Date - Publication] : &quot;2023&quot;[Date - Publication])
```


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Please enter this query into the search bar on the PubMed Central website to retrieve the relevant articles. Adjust the date range if necessary based on the current year to ensure the last five years are covered.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Solution&amp;Action:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>To formulate a search query for the arXiv database to find articles related to &quot;Machine Learning Algorithms&quot; published within the last five years, and include a filter for highly cited articles if possible, we will follow these steps:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>1. Identify the main keywords: &quot;Machine Learning Algorithms&quot;.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>2. Determine the time frame for the filter: Articles published within the last five years.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>3. Construct the search query using arXiv&#x27;s search syntax, which typically involves using the &quot;all:&quot; prefix for keywords and specifying the date range.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>4. arXiv does not have a direct filter for citation count in its search interface. However, we can sort the results by relevance and manually look for articles that have been cited frequently by checking the citation information usually provided in the search results or by using external citation databases.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>The search query for arXiv will look something like this:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>- Keywords: &quot;Machine Learning Algorithms&quot;</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>- Date Range: Last five years (from 2018 to the current year, if we are in 2023)</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>The actual search query to input in the arXiv search bar would be:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>all:&quot;Machine Learning Algorithms&quot; AND submittedDate:[20180101 TO 20231231]</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Since I cannot perform live searches on external databases, I will provide you with the search query format that you can use directly on the arXiv website:</span>



``` COMMAND TO PERFORM SEARCH ON ARXIV
Please use the following search query in the arXiv search interface:

```


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Please enter this query into the search bar on the arXiv website to retrieve the relevant articles. After obtaining the search results, you may sort them by relevance or look for articles that mention high citation counts in their abstracts or metadata. If you wish to identify highly cited articles, you may need to cross-reference with citation databases like Google Scholar or use tools that can analyze citation metrics.</span>
