<span style='color: blue;'>Instruction:</span>

<span style='color: blue;'>Begin the analysis by categorizing the curated list of articles based on their geographical focus, separating them into two groups: those that concentrate on research from North America and those that focus on research from Europe.</span>

<span style='color: blue;'>Input:</span>

<span style='color: blue;'>The curated list of articles from subtask 3.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>AI Assistant: AI Research Analyst</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Solution&amp;Action:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>To categorize the curated list of articles based on their geographical focus, I will perform the following steps:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>1. Review the list of articles provided from subtask 3 to understand the scope and content of each article.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>2. Create two separate lists or categories: one for articles focusing on research from North America and another for research from Europe.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>3. Read through the abstracts, affiliations, and any available author information to determine the primary geographical focus of the research. If an article&#x27;s focus is not immediately clear from the abstract, I will look for additional clues within the introduction or conclusion sections.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>4. Assign each article to the appropriate category based on the identified geographical focus.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>5. If any articles have a global focus or include significant contributions from both regions, I will create a third category for these and note the details for further discussion.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>6. Compile the categorized articles into a structured format, such as a spreadsheet, with columns for the article title, authors, publication year, and identified region.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Action:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Since I do not have access to the actual curated list of articles, I cannot physically perform the categorization. However, if I had the list, I would proceed as follows:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>1. Create a spreadsheet with columns for Article Title, Authors, Publication Year, and Region.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>2. Read through each article&#x27;s abstract and author information to determine the geographical focus.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>3. Enter the details of each article into the spreadsheet, categorizing them under the &#x27;Region&#x27; column as &#x27;North America&#x27;, &#x27;Europe&#x27;, or &#x27;Both/Global&#x27; as appropriate.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>4. Save and organize the spreadsheet for further analysis.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Since I cannot execute this action without the actual data, I will not perform any action at this moment. Please provide the list of articles or further instructions on how to proceed.</span>

<span style='color: blue;'>Instruction:</span>

<span style='color: blue;'>Proceed to identify the type of access for each article in the curated list, categorizing them as either open-access or subscription-based.</span>

<span style='color: blue;'>Input:</span>

<span style='color: blue;'>The categorized list of articles based on regional focus from the previous step.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>AI Assistant: AI Research Analyst</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Solution&amp;Action:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>To identify the type of access for each article in the categorized list, I will follow these steps:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>1. Review the categorized list of articles based on regional focus from the previous step to familiarize myself with the existing categorization.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>2. Create additional columns in the existing spreadsheet for &#x27;Access Type&#x27; and any relevant notes regarding the access status of the articles.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>3. For each article, check the journal or database where the article is published to determine if it is open-access or subscription-based. This can often be done by looking for access information on the article&#x27;s webpage or within the database itself.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>4. If the access type is not clearly stated, I will look for terms like &quot;Open Access,&quot; &quot;Free to Read,&quot; or &quot;Available Online&quot; which typically indicate open-access availability. If such terms are not present, I will assume the article is subscription-based unless further information is available.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>5. Record the access type for each article in the spreadsheet, marking them as &#x27;Open-Access&#x27; or &#x27;Subscription-Based&#x27; accordingly.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>6. If any articles have ambiguous access status or require payment for certain content while offering other content for free, I will note these details in the &#x27;Notes&#x27; column for further clarification.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Action:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>As I do not have the actual categorized list of articles or access to the databases and journals where they are published, I cannot physically perform the identification of access types. However, if I had the list and access to the required resources, I would proceed as follows:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>1. Open the existing spreadsheet with the categorized list of articles.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>2. Add the &#x27;Access Type&#x27; and &#x27;Notes&#x27; columns to the spreadsheet.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>3. Visit the webpage or database for each article to determine the access type.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>4. Update the spreadsheet with the access type for each article, along with any relevant notes.</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>5. Save the updated spreadsheet for further analysis.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Since I cannot execute this action without the actual data and access to the resources, I will not perform any action at this moment. Please provide the list of articles and access to the necessary databases or further instructions on how to proceed.</span>
