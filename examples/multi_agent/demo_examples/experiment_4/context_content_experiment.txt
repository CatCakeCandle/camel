Assume the population is constant and closed (no births, deaths, or migration).
Develop a set of differential equations using the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model framework but modify it to account for the immediate possibility of reinfection.
Include parameters for the rate of infection, the rate of recovery, and the rate of losing immunity (which in this case would be instantaneous).
Discuss the stability of the equilibrium points and interpret their epidemiological implications.
Perform a basic sensitivity analysis on one of your parameters to show how it affects the dynamics of the model.
