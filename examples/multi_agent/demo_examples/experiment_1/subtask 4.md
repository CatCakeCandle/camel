<span style='color: darkgreen;'>Solution&amp;Action:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>To test the Python script, we need to run it with sample input data. Here are the steps to follow:</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>1. Make sure the Python script and the sample input data are in the same directory.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>3. Run the Python script using the command:</span>

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>   </span>

```
   python script_name.py
   ```

<span style='color: darkgreen;'>   Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the Python script.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>4. Observe the output of the script. Check if it successfully parses the source code, extracts information about functions implemented under each module subdirectory, and generates the desired output.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>5. Compare the output of the script with the expected output based on the sample input data. Verify if the parsing, documentation generation, and other functionalities are accurate and working as expected.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>6. If there are any bugs, inconsistencies, or usability issues, take note of them and document them for further analysis and debugging.</span>


<span style='color: darkgreen;'>7. Repeat the testing process with different sample input data to ensure the script&#x27;s robustness and reliability.</span>
