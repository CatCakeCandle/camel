Show all steps and explain why each step is valid.\n\n1. **Definitions**:\n   - An **even number** is any integer that can be expressed in the form \\( 2k \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n   - An **odd number** is any integer that can be expressed in the form \\( 2k + 1 \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\n2. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to prove that if \\( n^2 \\) (n squared) is even, then \\( n \\) itself must also be even. This means we will show that the condition of \\( n^2 \\) being even leads to \\( n \\) being even.\n\n3. **Starting with the Assumption**: \n   - We begin with the assumption that \\( n^2 \\) is even. By definition, this means there exists some integer \\( m \\) such that:\n     \\[\n     n^2 = 2m\n     \\]\n\n4. **Exploring the Opposite Case**: \n   - To prove our statement, we will use a proof by contradiction. Thus, we assume the opposite of what we want to prove: that \\( n \\) is odd.\n   - If \\( n \\) is odd, we can express it as:\n     \\[\n     n = 2k + 1\n     \\]\n     for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Calculating \\( n^2 \\)**:\n   - Now, we will square \\( n \\) to see what happens:\n     \\[\n     n^2 = (2k + 1)^2\n     \\]\n   - Expanding this expression gives:\n     \\[\n     n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\n     \\]\n   - We can rewrite this as:\n     \\[\n     n^2 = 4k(k + 1) + 1\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( 4k(k + 1) \\) is even because it is a multiple of 4. However, when we add 1, we find that:\n     \\[\n     n^2 = \\text{(even)} + 1 = \\text{odd}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Identifying the Contradiction**:\n   - At this point, we have derived that if \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( n^2 \\) must be odd. However, this contradicts our initial assumption that \\( n^2 \\) is even (i.e., \\( n^2 = 2m \\)).\n   - Since \\( n^2 \\) cannot be both even and odd at the same time, we have reached a contradiction.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Because our assumption that \\( n \\) is odd leads to a contradiction, we conclude that our assumption must be false. Therefore, \\( n \\) cannot be odd, which implies that \\( n \\) must be even.\n\n**Summary**: We have shown that if \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) must also be even by assuming the opposite (that \\( n \\) is odd) and arriving at a contradiction.

The absolute value means we need to consider different cases based on the values of \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 2: Break it Down into Parts\nThe absolute value expressions \\( |x - 2| \\) and \\( |x + 1| \\) change depending on the value of \\( x \\). We need to find the points where each expression changes, which happens at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\). So, we will consider three cases based on these points:\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( x < -1 \\)\n2. **Case 2:** \\( -1 \\leq x < 2 \\)\n3. **Case 3:** \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Solve Each Part Systematically\n\n**Case 1: \\( x < -1 \\)**  \nIn this case, both expressions are negative, so we rewrite them without the absolute values:\n\\[\n|x - 2| = -(x - 2) = -x + 2\n\\]\n\\[\n|x + 1| = -(x + 1) = -x - 1\n\\]\nNow, substituting into the equation:\n\\[\n(-x + 2) + (-x - 1) = 7\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n-2x + 1 = 7\n\\]\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n-2x = 6\n\\]\nDividing by -2:\n\\[\nx = -3\n\\]\nSince \\( -3 < -1 \\), this solution is valid.\n\n**Case 2: \\( -1 \\leq x < 2 \\)**  \nHere, \\( |x - 2| \\) is still negative, but \\( |x + 1| \\) is positive:\n\\[\n|x - 2| = -(x - 2) = -x + 2\n\\]\n\\[\n|x + 1| = x + 1\n\\]\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\\[\n(-x + 2) + (x + 1) = 7\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 + 1 = 7\n\\]\nWhich is:\n\\[\n3 = 7\n\\]\nThis is not true, so there are no solutions in this case.\n\n**Case 3: \\( x \\geq 2 \\)**  \nIn this case, both expressions are positive:\n\\[\n|x - 2| = x - 2\n\\]\n\\[\n|x + 1| = x + 1\n\\]\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\\[\n(x - 2) + (x + 1) = 7\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2x - 1 = 7\n\\]\nAdding 1 to both sides gives:\n\\[\n2x = 8\n\\]\nDividing by 2:\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]\nSince \\( 4 \\geq 2 \\), this solution is valid.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Our Solutions\nNow we have two potential solutions: \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n**Verification for \\( x = -3 \\):**\n\\[\n|x - 2| + |x + 1| = |-3 - 2| + |-3 + 1| = | -5 | + | -2 | = 5 + 2 = 7\n\\]\nThis is correct.\n\n**Verification for \\( x = 4 \\):**\n\\[\n|x - 2| + |x + 1| = |4 - 2| + |4 + 1| = |2| + |5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\\]\nThis is also correct.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation \\( |x - 2| + |x + 1| = 7 \\) are \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\).",

Let's tackle this problem step by step, even though I might not be the best at explaining things clearly.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe have 8 different books, and among these, there are 3 specific books that need to be kept together. This means we can think of these 3 books as one single unit or \"block.\" So, instead of 8 individual books, we can think of it as having 6 individual books plus 1 block of 3 books.\n\n### Step 2: Break It Down\n1. **Count the blocks**: We have 6 individual books + 1 block of 3 books = 7 units to arrange.\n2. **Arrange the block**: The 3 books within the block can be arranged among themselves in different ways.\n\n### Step 3: Solve Each Part\n1. **Arrange the 7 units**: The number of ways to arrange 7 units (6 individual books + 1 block) is given by the factorial of 7, which is \\(7!\\).\n   - \\(7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\\)\n\n2. **Arrange the 3 books within the block**: The number of ways to arrange the 3 books within the block is given by \\(3!\\).\n   - \\(3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results\nNow, to find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of arrangements of the 7 units by the arrangements of the 3 books within the block:\n- Total arrangements = \\(7! \\times 3! = 5040 \\times 6\\)\n\nCalculating that gives:\n- \\(5040 \\times 6 = 30240\\)\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Solution\nTo verify, we can think about it logically:\n- We have 7 units to arrange, which we calculated as \\(7!\\).\n- The 3 books can be arranged in \\(3!\\) ways.\n- So, multiplying those two results should give us the correct total arrangements.\n\nThe calculations seem consistent, and I think the final answer is **30,240** ways to arrange the 8 books with the 3 specific books kept together.\n\nI hope this explanation makes sense, even if it\u2019s a bit jumbled!",
