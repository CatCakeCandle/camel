So, x = -3 is a solution.\n\n   - **Case 2**: -1 \u2264 x < 2\n     - In this case, |x - 2| is still negative and |x + 1| is positive:\n       |x - 2| = -(x - 2) = -x + 2\n       |x + 1| = x + 1\n       The equation becomes:\n       -x + 2 + x + 1 = 7\n       3 = 7\n       This is not true, so there are no solutions in this case.\n\n   - **Case 3**: x \u2265 2\n     - Here, both expressions are positive:\n       |x - 2| = x - 2\n       |x + 1| = x + 1\n       The equation becomes:\n       x - 2 + x + 1 = 7\n       2x - 1 = 7\n       2x = 8\n       x = 4\n       We check if 4 is greater than or equal to 2, which it is.

This means we can think of these 3 books as one single unit or \"block\". So, instead of 8 books, we can think of it as having 6 units: the block of 3 books and the other 5 individual books.\n\n2. **Breaking it Down**: \n   - We have 1 block (the 3 books together) and 5 other books. So, we have a total of 6 units to arrange.\n   - The 3 books inside the block can be arranged among themselves in different ways.\n\n3. **Solving Each Part**:\n   - First, let\u2019s find the number of ways to arrange the 6 units (the block + 5 books). The number of ways to arrange n different items is n!. So, for our 6 units, it would be 6! (which is 6 factorial).\n   - Then, we need to arrange the 3 books within the block. The number of ways to arrange these 3 books is 3! (which is 3 factorial).\n\n   So, the total number of arrangements would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total arrangements} = 6! \\times 3!\n   \\]\n\n   Now, let\u2019s calculate these factorials:\n   - 6! = 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 720\n   - 3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\n   Now, multiplying these together:\n   \\[\n   720 \\times 6 = 4320\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verifying the Solution**: \n   - We calculated that there are 4320 ways to arrange the books. To verify, we can think about it logically: we grouped the 3 books together, treated them as one unit, and then arranged everything. The calculations seem to follow the logic of arranging groups and items correctly.\n\nSo, the final answer is that there are **4320 ways** to arrange the 8 different books with the condition that the 3 specific books must always be kept together.
