So, we have two quadratic polynomials, P(x) and Q(x). Their leading coefficients are 2 and -2, respectively. Both of their graphs pass through the points (16, 54) and (20, 53). We need to find P(0) + Q(0). Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, since they are quadratic polynomials, they have the general form. Let me write that down. For P(x), the leading coefficient is 2, so it should be P(x) = 2x² + bx + c, where b and c are constants. Similarly, Q(x) has a leading coefficient of -2, so Q(x) = -2x² + dx + e, where d and e are constants.\n\nBoth P and Q pass through (16, 54) and (20, 53). That means when we plug in x = 16 into both functions, the output is 54, and when we plug in x = 20, the output is 53. So, we can set up equations for both polynomials.\n\nLet me start with P(x). For x = 16, P(16) = 54. So:\n\n2*(16)² + b*(16) + c = 54.\n\nCalculating 16 squared: 16*16 is 256. So, 2*256 = 512. Then, 512 + 16b + c = 54.\n\nSo, 16b + c = 54 - 512 = -458. Let me check that: 512 + 16b + c = 54 => 16b + c = 54 - 512 = -458. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, for x = 20, P(20) = 53:\n\n2*(20)² + b*(20) + c = 53.\n\n20 squared is 400, so 2*400 = 800. Then, 800 + 20b + c = 53. So, 20b + c = 53 - 800 = -747.\n\nSo, we have two equations for P(x):\n\n1) 16b + c = -458\n\n2) 20b + c = -747\n\nIf we subtract the first equation from the second, we get (20b + c) - (16b + c) = -747 - (-458) => 4b = -747 + 458. Let's compute that: 458 - 747. Hmm, 747 - 458 is 289, so this is -289. Therefore, 4b = -289 => b = -289 / 4. Let me check that again. 747 - 458 is 289, yes, so -747 + 458 is -289. Therefore, 4b = -289, so b = -289/4. Which is -72.25. Hmm, decimal, but maybe we can keep it as a fraction.\n\nThen, substituting back into equation 1: 16b + c = -458. So, c = -458 -16b. Plugging b = -289/4:\n\nc = -458 -16*(-289/4) = -458 + (16/4)*289 = -458 + 4*289.\n\n4*289: 289*4. Let's compute that. 289*2 is 578, so 578*2 is 1156. So, 4*289 = 1156.\n\nThus, c = -458 + 1156 = 698. Wait, 1156 - 458. Let me subtract: 1156 - 400 = 756, then subtract 58 more: 756 -58=698. Yes.\n\nSo, for P(x), b = -289/4 and c = 698. So, P(x) = 2x² - (289/4)x + 698.\n\nSimilarly, now let's do the same for Q(x). Q(x) has leading coefficient -2, so Q(x) = -2x² + dx + e.\n\nUsing the points (16, 54) and (20, 53):\n\nFirst, Q(16) = 54:\n\n-2*(16)² + d*16 + e = 54.\n\n16 squared is 256, so -2*256 = -512. Then, -512 +16d + e = 54 => 16d + e = 54 + 512 = 566.\n\nSecond, Q(20) = 53:\n\n-2*(20)² + d*20 + e = 53.\n\n20 squared is 400, so -2*400 = -800. Thus, -800 +20d + e =53 => 20d + e = 53 +800 = 853.\n\nSo, the equations for Q(x):\n\n1) 16d + e = 566\n\n2) 20d + e = 853\n\nSubtracting first from second: (20d + e) - (16d + e) = 853 -566 => 4d = 287 => d =287/4. Let me check: 853 -566. 800-500=300, 53-66= -13, so 300-13=287. Yes. So, 4d=287 => d=287/4=71.75.\n\nThen, substitute back into first equation: 16d + e =566. So, e=566 -16d.\n\nPlugging d=287/4:\n\ne=566 -16*(287/4)=566 -4*287.\n\n4*287: 287*4. 200*4=800, 80*4=320, 7*4=28. So, 800+320=1120 +28=1148. Therefore, e=566 -1148= -582.\n\nSo, Q(x) = -2x² + (287/4)x -582.\n\nNow, we need to find P(0) + Q(0). Since P(0) is the constant term of P(x), which is c=698. Q(0) is the constant term of Q(x), which is e=-582. So, 698 + (-582) = 116. Wait, 698 -582. Let's compute that. 582 + 100 = 682, 682 +16=698. So, 582 +116=698. Therefore, 698 -582=116. So, the answer is 116?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made an error in calculation. Let me verify.\n\nFor P(x), c was 698. For Q(x), e was -582. So, 698 + (-582) = 116. That seems right. Let me check the steps again.\n\nFor P(x):\n\nAt x=16: 2*(16)^2 +b*16 +c=54. 2*256=512. 512 +16b +c=54. So 16b +c= -458.\n\nAt x=20: 2*400=800. 800 +20b +c=53. So 20b +c= -747.\n\nSubtracting first equation from second: 4b= -289 => b= -289/4. Then c= -458 -16*(-289/4)= -458 + (16/4)*289= -458 +4*289= -458 +1156=698. Correct.\n\nFor Q(x):\n\nAt x=16: -2*(256) +16d +e=54. -512 +16d +e=54. 16d +e=566.\n\nAt x=20: -800 +20d +e=53. So 20d +e=853.\n\nSubtract first equation from second: 4d=287 => d=287/4. Then e=566 -16*(287/4)=566 -4*287=566 -1148= -582. Correct.\n\nSo, P(0)=698, Q(0)=-582. Sum: 698-582=116. So, the answer should be 116. Wait, but let me check once more. Maybe I miscalculated 698 -582.\n\n582 subtracted from 698:\n\nStart from 582:\n\n582 +100=682\n\n682 +16=698. So, that's 100+16=116. So, 698 -582=116. Yes, that's correct. So, the answer is 116.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there a smarter way to do this without computing all coefficients? Maybe. For example, if we add P(x) and Q(x), let's see:\n\nLet R(x) = P(x) + Q(x). Then R(x) is (2x² + bx + c) + (-2x² + dx + e) = (2-2)x² + (b+d)x + (c+e). So, the quadratic terms cancel out. Therefore, R(x) is a linear function: R(x) = (b + d)x + (c + e). Therefore, R(x) is linear.\n\nGiven that both P and Q pass through (16, 54) and (20, 53), then R(16) = P(16) + Q(16) =54 +54=108? Wait, no. Wait, if P(16)=54 and Q(16)=54, then R(16)=54+54=108? Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no. Wait, if both P and Q pass through (16,54), then P(16)=54 and Q(16)=54. Therefore, R(16)=54+54=108. Similarly, R(20)=53+53=106. Wait, but then R(x) is a linear function passing through (16,108) and (20,106). Then, we can compute the slope of R(x) as (106 -108)/(20 -16)= (-2)/4= -1/2. Then, the equation of R(x) is y -108 = (-1/2)(x -16). Then, to find R(0), we can plug x=0. So, y=108 + (-1/2)(-16)=108 +8=116. Therefore, R(0)=116. Since R(0)=P(0)+Q(0), this is the answer. So, this is a more efficient way.\n\nWow, that's smarter. Instead of solving for all coefficients, just adding the two polynomials. Since the quadratics cancel out, it's linear, and since it passes through those two summed points, we can find R(0) directly. So, that's a better approach. But in my initial thinking, I went through solving both quadratics. But either way, the answer is 116. Let me confirm with this second method.\n\nYes, let's do that. So, R(x) = P(x) + Q(x). Since P and Q are quadratics with leading coefficients 2 and -2, their sum R(x) is linear. So, R(x) is a line. The points that R(x) passes through are (16, 108) and (20, 106). Because at x=16, both P and Q are 54, so sum is 108. At x=20, both are 53, sum is 106. So, two points on R(x): (16,108) and (20,106).\n\nThe slope of R(x) is (106 -108)/(20 -16) = (-2)/4 = -0.5 = -1/2. Then, the equation of the line can be written as:\n\ny - 108 = (-1/2)(x -16).\n\nTo find R(0), set x=0:\n\ny -108 = (-1/2)(0 -16) = (-1/2)(-16)=8.\n\nTherefore, y=108 +8=116. So, R(0)=116, which is P(0)+Q(0). So, that's the same answer as before, but without having to compute all the coefficients. So, this is a smarter approach. Therefore, the answer is 116.\n\nBut since the problem didn't restrict the method, both approaches work. The second one is just more efficient. Therefore, the answer is 116.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{116}",

A plane intersects each of them, creating three congruent circles centered at points A, B, and C. The centers of the spheres are all on the same side of this plane. We're given that AB² is 560, and we need to find AC².\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There are three spheres, each touching the other two externally. Their centers form a triangle, right? The radii are 11, 13, and 19. So, the distances between the centers should be the sum of their radii. Let me check that. If two spheres are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii. So, the distance between the centers of the first and second sphere would be 11 + 13 = 24, between the first and third would be 11 + 19 = 30, and between the second and third would be 13 + 19 = 32. So, the triangle formed by the centers has sides 24, 30, and 32. Let me note that down.\n\nNow, there's a plane that intersects each sphere, creating three congruent circles. The centers of these circles are A, B, and C. The centers of the spheres are all on the same side of the plane. So, the plane is cutting each sphere at some height, creating circles. Since the circles are congruent, their radii must be equal. Let me denote the radius of each circle as r.\n\nSince the plane is cutting each sphere, the distance from the center of each sphere to the plane must be such that when you slice the sphere at that distance, the cross-section is a circle with radius r. For a sphere of radius R, if you cut it at a distance h from the center, the radius of the cross-section is sqrt(R² - h²). Therefore, since all three circles have radius r, the distances from each sphere's center to the plane must satisfy:\n\nsqrt(11² - h₁²) = sqrt(13² - h₂²) = sqrt(19² - h₃²) = r\n\nWhere h₁, h₂, h₃ are the distances from the centers of the respective spheres to the plane. Since all centers are on the same side of the plane, these h's are all measured in the same direction. Let me denote the distances as h₁, h₂, h₃. So, each h is the distance from the sphere's center to the plane. Therefore, the radii of the circles are related by:\n\nr² = 11² - h₁² = 13² - h₂² = 19² - h₃²\n\nTherefore, h₁ = sqrt(11² - r²), h₂ = sqrt(13² - r²), h₃ = sqrt(19² - r²). Wait, no. Actually, if the radius of the circle is r, then r² = R² - h², so h = sqrt(R² - r²). Wait, actually, h is the distance from the center to the plane. If the sphere has radius R, and the cross-section has radius r, then h = sqrt(R² - r²). Wait, no. Let me think again. If you have a sphere with radius R, and you slice it with a plane at distance h from the center, the radius of the circle is sqrt(R² - h²). So, h = sqrt(R² - r²). Wait, no. If h is the distance from the center to the plane, then the radius of the circle is sqrt(R² - h²). So, yes, given that, r = sqrt(R² - h²). Therefore, h = sqrt(R² - r²). So, h is a function of R and r.\n\nBut since all three circles have the same radius r, the distances from each center to the plane are h₁ = sqrt(11² - r²), h₂ = sqrt(13² - r²), h₃ = sqrt(19² - r²). But since all centers are on the same side of the plane, these h's are all positive distances.\n\nNow, the centers of the spheres form a triangle with sides 24, 30, 32. The centers of the circles A, B, C are projections of the sphere centers onto the plane. Wait, not exactly. The centers A, B, C are the centers of the circles formed by the intersection of the plane with the spheres. But the centers of the spheres are points in space, and the plane is cutting each sphere. So, the center of each circle (A, B, C) is the point where the plane intersects the line perpendicular to the plane passing through the sphere's center. So, if I imagine each sphere's center is a point, and the plane is cutting the sphere, the center of the circle is the projection of the sphere's center onto the plane.\n\nWait, yes. If you have a sphere with center O and radius R, and a plane at distance h from O, then the center of the circle (A) is the projection of O onto the plane. So, A is the foot of the perpendicular from O to the plane. Similarly for B and C.\n\nTherefore, the distance between A and B is equal to the distance between the projections of the centers of the first and second spheres onto the plane. Let me denote the centers of the spheres as O₁, O₂, O₃ with radii 11, 13, 19 respectively. The centers O₁, O₂, O₃ form a triangle with sides O₁O₂ = 24, O₁O₃ = 30, O₂O₃ = 32. Then, the centers A, B, C are the projections of O₁, O₂, O₃ onto the plane. The distance between A and B can be related to the distance between O₁ and O₂ and the heights h₁ and h₂.\n\nSince A and B are projections of O₁ and O₂ onto the plane, the distance AB is equal to the distance between O₁ and O₂ projected onto the plane. The distance between O₁ and O₂ is 24. The projection of O₁O₂ onto the plane can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The line segment O₁O₂ can be thought of as the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where one leg is the distance AB, and the other leg is the difference in heights h₁ and h₂. Wait, but since the plane is the same for both, the vertical distance between O₁ and O₂ relative to the plane would be |h₁ - h₂|. So, AB² = O₁O₂² - (h₁ - h₂)². Similarly, since O₁O₂ is 24, then AB² = 24² - (h₁ - h₂)^2.\n\nBut wait, AB is given as 560. Wait, AB² is 560. So, 560 = 24² - (h₁ - h₂)^2. Wait, 24 squared is 576, so 560 = 576 - (h₁ - h₂)^2. Then, (h₁ - h₂)^2 = 576 - 560 = 16. Therefore, h₁ - h₂ = ±4. But since all centers are on the same side of the plane, the h's are all measured from the centers to the plane on the same side. So, if the centers are all on the same side, then the heights h₁, h₂, h₃ are all measured in the same direction. Therefore, the difference h₁ - h₂ would be positive if h₁ > h₂, or negative otherwise. But the square is 16, so the absolute difference is 4.\n\nSimilarly, we need to find AC². Let's see. The same logic would apply for AC. The distance between A and C is the projection of O₁O₃ onto the plane, which would be AC² = O₁O₃² - (h₁ - h₃)^2. Since O₁O₃ is 30, then AC² = 30² - (h₁ - h₃)^2 = 900 - (h₁ - h₃)^2. So, if we can find (h₁ - h₃)^2, we can compute AC².\n\nSo, the key is to find h₁, h₂, h₃. Since we know that the radii of the circles are equal, we have:\n\nr² = 11² - h₁² = 13² - h₂² = 19² - h₃²\n\nFrom this, we can express h₂² = 13² - (11² - h₁²) = 169 - 121 + h₁² = 48 + h₁²\n\nSimilarly, h₃² = 19² - (11² - h₁²) = 361 - 121 + h₁² = 240 + h₁²\n\nBut we also know that (h₁ - h₂)^2 = 16. Let's expand that:\n\n(h₁ - h₂)^2 = h₁² - 2h₁h₂ + h₂² = 16\n\nBut from above, h₂² = 48 + h₁². Substitute that in:\n\nh₁² - 2h₁h₂ + (48 + h₁²) = 16\n\nSo, 2h₁² - 2h₁h₂ + 48 = 16\n\nSubtract 16:\n\n2h₁² - 2h₁h₂ + 32 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nh₁² - h₁h₂ + 16 = 0\n\nHmm, but h₂² = 48 + h₁². Let me write h₂ in terms of h₁. Since h₂² = 48 + h₁², then h₂ = sqrt(48 + h₁²). But h₂ is a distance, so positive. Therefore, h₂ = sqrt(h₁² + 48). Plugging into the equation h₁² - h₁h₂ + 16 = 0:\n\nh₁² - h₁*sqrt(h₁² + 48) + 16 = 0\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Let me see if there's another way. Alternatively, we can use the equations from the problem.\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. From AB² = 560: (h₁ - h₂)^2 = 24² - 560 = 576 - 560 = 16\n\n2. From the radii equality: 11² - h₁² = 13² - h₂² => h₂² - h₁² = 169 - 121 = 48\n\nSimilarly, 11² - h₁² = 19² - h₃² => h₃² - h₁² = 361 - 121 = 240\n\nSo, we have:\n\nh₂² - h₁² = 48\n\nh₃² - h₁² = 240\n\nAdditionally, (h₁ - h₂)^2 = 16\n\nLet me denote x = h₁, y = h₂, z = h₃.\n\nThen:\n\ny² - x² = 48 ...(1)\n\nz² - x² = 240 ...(2)\n\n(x - y)^2 = 16 ...(3)\n\nWe need to find (x - z)^2, since AC² = 30² - (x - z)^2 = 900 - (x - z)^2.\n\nSo, first, solve equations (1), (2), (3) for x, y, z.\n\nFrom (1): y² = x² + 48\n\nFrom (3): (x - y)^2 = 16 => x² - 2xy + y² = 16\n\nBut substituting y² from (1):\n\nx² - 2xy + x² + 48 = 16\n\nSo, 2x² - 2xy + 48 = 16\n\nSubtract 16:\n\n2x² - 2xy + 32 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx² - xy + 16 = 0\n\nSo, x² - xy + 16 = 0 ...(4)\n\nBut from (1): y = sqrt(x² + 48). Wait, but maybe we can express y in terms of x.\n\nAlternatively, let's solve equation (4) for y:\n\nx² - xy + 16 = 0 => y = (x² + 16)/x\n\nBut from (1): y² = x² + 48\n\nSo, substitute y into this:\n\n[(x² + 16)/x]^2 = x² + 48\n\nExpand left side:\n\n(x² + 16)^2 / x² = x² + 48\n\nMultiply both sides by x²:\n\n(x² + 16)^2 = x²(x² + 48)\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx^4 + 32x² + 256 = x^4 + 48x²\n\nSubtract x^4 from both sides:\n\n32x² + 256 = 48x²\n\nSubtract 32x²:\n\n256 = 16x²\n\nDivide by 16:\n\nx² = 16\n\nTherefore, x = 4 or x = -4. But since h₁ is a distance from the center to the plane, and centers are on the same side, h₁ must be positive. So, x = 4.\n\nThen, y = (x² + 16)/x = (16 + 16)/4 = 32/4 = 8\n\nCheck if this works with equation (1): y² - x² = 64 - 16 = 48, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2): z² - x² = 240 => z² = 240 + x² = 240 + 16 = 256 => z = 16 (since distance is positive)\n\nTherefore, h₁ = 4, h₂ = 8, h₃ = 16\n\nNow, we need to compute AC². AC is the distance between points A and C, which are the projections of O₁ and O₃ onto the plane. The distance AC² is equal to O₁O₃² - (h₁ - h₃)^2. Since O₁O₃ is 30, then:\n\nAC² = 30² - (h₁ - h₃)^2 = 900 - (4 - 16)^2 = 900 - (-12)^2 = 900 - 144 = 756\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nWe found h₁ = 4, h₂ = 8, h₃ = 16. Then, (h₁ - h₃) = 4 - 16 = -12, squared is 144. Therefore, AC² = 30² - 144 = 900 - 144 = 756.\n\nBut let me confirm if the formula AC² = O₁O₃² - (h₁ - h₃)^2 is correct. The idea is that the distance between the projections of two points onto a plane is equal to the original distance squared minus the square of the difference in heights (since the projection removes the component perpendicular to the plane). So, yes, if two points are at heights h₁ and h₃ above the plane, then the distance between their projections is sqrt(d² - (h₁ - h₃)^2), so squared distance is d² - (h₁ - h₃)^2. Therefore, AC² = 30² - (4 - 16)^2 = 900 - 144 = 756.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 756.\n\nBut let me check if the heights h₁, h₂, h₃ are indeed 4, 8, 16. Let's verify:\n\nFrom the radii:\n\nr² = 11² - h₁² = 121 - 16 = 105\n\nSimilarly, 13² - h₂² = 169 - 64 = 105\n\n19² - h₃² = 361 - 256 = 105\n\nYes, all three give r² = 105. So, the radius of each circle is sqrt(105). That makes sense. So the heights are correctly computed.\n\nTherefore, AC² is 756.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{756}",
