However, this contradicts our initial assumption that \\( n^2 \\) is even.\n   - Therefore, our assumption that \\( n \\) is odd must be false.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \\( n \\) cannot be odd, it must be even.

          "trace": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe need to find the number of ways to arrange 8 different books on a shelf, with the condition that 3 specific books must always be kept together. This means we can treat these 3 books as a single unit or \"block\" when arranging the books.\n\n### Step 2: Break Down the Problem\n1. **Group the 3 specific books together**: Since these 3 books must be together, we can consider them as one single \"block\". This reduces the total number of items we need to arrange.\n2. **Count the total items to arrange**: After grouping the 3 books, we have:\n   - 1 block (of 3 books)\n   - 5 other individual books\n   - This gives us a total of \\(1 + 5 = 6\\) items to arrange.\n3. **Arrange the books within the block**: The 3 specific books can be arranged among themselves in different ways.\n\n### Step 3: Solve Each Part Systematically\n1. **Arrange the 6 items (5 individual books + 1 block)**:\n   The number of ways to arrange 6 items is given by the factorial of the number of items:\n   \\[\n   6! = 720\n   \\]\n\n2. **Arrange the 3 specific books within the block**:\n   The number of ways to arrange the 3 books within their block is:\n   \\[\n   3! = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the arrangements**:\n   To find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of arrangements of the blocks by the arrangements of the books within the block:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total arrangements} = 6! \\times 3! = 720 \\times 6 = 4320\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Solution\nTo verify, we can check our calculations:\n- \\(6! = 720\\) is correct.\n- \\(3! = 6\\) is also correct.\n- Multiplying these gives \\(720 \\times 6 = 4320\\), which is accurate.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total number of ways to arrange 8 different books on a shelf, with the condition that 3 specific books must always be kept together, is **4320**. \n\nThis approach systematically breaks down the problem, ensuring that we account for both the grouping of the specific books and their internal arrangements.",
