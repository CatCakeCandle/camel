This is a conditional statement that we will prove using a direct proof approach.\n\n### Step 2: Break Down the Problem\n1. **Definitions**:\n   - An integer is **even** if it can be expressed as \\( 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n   - An integer is **odd** if it can be expressed as \\( 2k + 1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Given**: \\( n^2 \\) is even.\n3. **To Prove**: \\( n \\) is even.\n\n### Step 3: Solve Each Part Systematically\nWe will use a proof by contrapositive, which states that instead of proving \\( P \\implies Q \\) directly, we can prove \\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\). In this case:\n- Let \\( P \\): \\( n^2 \\) is even.\n- Let \\( Q \\): \\( n \\) is even.\n- Then \\( \\neg Q \\): \\( n \\) is odd.\n- And \\( \\neg P \\): \\( n^2 \\) is odd.\n\n**Proof**:\n1. Assume \\( n \\) is odd. By definition of odd integers, we can express \\( n \\) as:\n   \\[\n   n = 2k + 1\n   \\]\n   for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n2. Now, we will calculate \\( n^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   n^2 = (2k + 1)^2\n   \\]\n   Expanding this using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\( n^2 \\) can be expressed in the form \\( 2m + 1 \\) where \\( m = 2k^2 + 2k \\) is an integer. Thus, \\( n^2 \\) is odd.\n\n3. Since we assumed \\( n \\) is odd and derived that \\( n^2 \\) is odd, we have shown that if \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( n^2 \\) is odd. This means that the contrapositive holds:\n   \\[\n   n^2 \\text{ is even} \\implies n \\text{ is even}.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Solution\nTo verify, we can check our logic:\n- We started with the assumption that \\( n \\) is odd and showed that this leads to \\( n^2 \\) being odd.\n- Thus, if \\( n^2 \\) is even, \\( n \\) cannot be odd, which means \\( n \\) must be even.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have successfully proven that for any positive integer \\( n \\), if \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even. This proof is valid based on the definitions of even and odd integers, and the logical structure of the contrapositive.",
