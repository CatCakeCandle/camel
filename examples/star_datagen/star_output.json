The contrapositive of the statement is logically equivalent to the original statement and can often be easier to prove. The contrapositive in this case is: \"If \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( n^2 \\) is odd.\"\n\n### Step 1: Understand what's being asked\nWe need to show that if the square of a positive integer \\( n \\) is even, then \\( n \\) itself must also be even. This involves understanding the definitions of even and odd numbers:\n- An integer \\( n \\) is **even** if there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( n = 2k \\).\n- An integer \\( n \\) is **odd** if there exists an integer \\( m \\) such that \\( n = 2m + 1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Break this down into parts\n1. Define what it means for \\( n^2 \\) to be even.\n2. Define what it means for \\( n \\) to be odd.\n3. Show that if \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( n^2 \\) is odd.\n\n### Step 3: Solve each part systematically\n\n1. **Assume \\( n \\) is odd**: \n   - By definition, if \\( n \\) is odd, we can write \\( n = 2m + 1 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( n^2 \\)**:\n   - Now, we compute \\( n^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   n^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 2(2m^2 + 2m) + 1\n   \\]\n   - Notice that \\( 2m^2 + 2m \\) is an integer (since \\( m \\) is an integer), so we can denote it as \\( k \\) where \\( k = 2m^2 + 2m \\).\n\n3. **Express \\( n^2 \\) in terms of \\( k \\)**:\n   - Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   n^2 = 2k + 1\n   \\]\n   - This shows that \\( n^2 \\) is of the form \\( 2k + 1 \\), which is the definition of an odd number.\n\n### Step 4: Verify your solution\nSince we have shown that if \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( n^2 \\) is odd, we can conclude that the contrapositive is true. Therefore, the original statement \"if \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even\" must also be true.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have proven that for any positive integer \\( n \\), if \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even. This reasoning is valid because we used definitions of even and odd numbers and logically derived the relationship between \\( n \\) and \\( n^2 \\). Thus, the proof is complete and correct.",
