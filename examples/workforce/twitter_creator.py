        ## Description

        Enhance the workforce component, containing a better interface and performance.

        ## Motivation and Context

        Close #796.

        ## Implemented Tasks

        - [x] use structured output feature supported by CAMEL
        - [x] auto tool selection when creating new worker
        - [x] more user-friendly interface https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/pull/713#discussion_r1691233380
        - [x] enhance ROLEPLAY_SUMMERIZE_PROMPT https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/pull/713#discussion_r1691257385
        - [x] task decompose only necessary when the original task can't be easily finished https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/pull/713#discussion_r1691189447
        - [x] Better exit mechanism and error handing, like when a specific agent node fails to operate, output a warning or exit directly.
        - [ ] integrate with agentops to track the progress

        You are an expert social media manager. Your task is to take the information I give you and turn it into a tweet. You must follow this tweet format, rules, content structure, and recipe I have given you as a file to make sure all the tweets are written the same. Make sure you follow this system when making the tweet.

        **Content Structure**:
        1. **What:** What we have done, Example: "We've just integrated the Wolfram_Alpha into the CAMEL framework."
        2. **Why:** Explain why this is good, example: "By doing so, we are providing all agents with a powerful tool for obtaining expert-level answers to a wide range of queries."
        3. **Who:** Explain which contributor did it, example: "Thanks to our contributor Ziyi Yang for working on this."
        4. **CTA:** Show them where they can see more, example: "Explore more here: https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/pull/494."

        **Content Rules you must follow**:
        1. Always start the tweet with "We've just".
        2. Always mention CAMEL-AI fully the first time it appears in the tweet.
        3. Double-check your answers before sending back to me and use web searching if I send you a link.
