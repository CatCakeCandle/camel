    "In this tutorial, we will explore the `Runtimes` in CAMEL, focusing on three specific runtime implementations: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `LLMGuardRuntime`: This runtime evaluates the risk level of functions using a language model. It ensures that potentially harmful functions are assessed and controlled before execution. The runtime uses a prompt-based approach to determine the risk score of a function based on its description and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `RemoteHttpRuntime`: This runtime allows functions to be executed on a remote HTTP server. It is useful for distributing workloads across different servers and ensuring that functions run in a controlled remote environment. The runtime supports custom entry points and arguments, and provides mechanisms to check server status and wait for readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `DockerRuntime`: This runtime provides a containerized environment for executing functions using Docker. It ensures that functions run in isolated and reproducible environments, making it ideal for complex workflows and dependency management. The runtime supports mounting directories, copying files to containers, and adding tasks to execute commands inside containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these runtimes provides a unique environment for executing functions, ensuring safety, remote execution, and containerized execution, respectively."
